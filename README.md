# Understanding This Repo

I'm currently doing [this Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-how-to-code/ "Learn How To Code: Google's Go (golang) Programming Language") by Todd McLeod.

Each directory is a completely seperate Go program; they exist in subdirectories of a single repo so that my GitHub account isn't littered with small, individually insignificant repos.

( Did you notice the link's on-hover text? :) )
